## Lesson 1. CRUD Fundamentals with Google Sheets

This lesson introduces the **foundational data operations** that every automation and AI-driven system relies on. CRUD is not optional knowledge. It is the base layer on which all reliable workflows are built.

Before agents reason, data must exist.  
Before insights emerge, data must be correct.

### Objective of this Lesson

To understand how **data is created, read, updated, and deleted** inside a system using Google Sheets as a visible and controllable data store.

This lesson trains students to think like operators, not prompt writers.

---

### What this lesson covers

- **Create**. Insert new records into a sheet  
- **Read**. Fetch existing rows for processing  
- **Update**. Modify records based on logic or conditions  
- **Delete**. Remove rows or columns safely

Each operation is demonstrated independently to ensure clarity.

---

### Why this lesson matters

Most automation failures are not AI failures.  
They are **data handling failures**.

This lesson builds discipline around:
- Data integrity
- Explicit state changes
- Predictable system behavior

Without mastering CRUD, higher-level concepts like agents, analytics, and RAG will break under scale.

---

### Mental model to keep in mind

- Google Sheets represents system state
- n8n executes data operations
- Every node changes state deliberately

If you cannot explain what happens to the data after each step, you are moving too fast.
