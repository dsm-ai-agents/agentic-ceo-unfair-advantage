# Agent Mastery & Deployment Program  
**13-Week Foundation + Project-Based Implementation**

---

## Executive Summary

This program is built for professionals who want to move beyond “learning AI tools” and become **trusted builders of AI agents** that can operate in real business environments.

The journey is intentionally split into **three phases**:

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–6):** Build strong agent foundations  
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 7–10):** Apply foundations through **guided group projects** (open to participant feedback)  
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 11–13):** Deploy agents as real products using Lovable  

The **13 weeks exist to give you the capability** to confidently design and build agents of your choice.  
The **projects you complete determine your certification**.

This is a **product-first, decision-first, deployment-first program**.

## Preparatory Learning (Before Week 1)

> This section helps you get the most out of the program.  
> No coding expertise is required, but familiarity with these concepts will accelerate your learning.

### Core Concepts to Be Aware Of
- What is an **AI Agent** (vs chatbot vs automation)
- Decision-making vs task execution
- Human-in-the-loop systems
- Structured vs unstructured data
- What “delegation to AI” actually means

### Key Terminologies (You Will Hear These Often)
- Prompt  
- Context window  
- Embeddings  
- Vector database  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- Tokens & cost  
- Latency  
- Fallbacks  
- Observability  
- Escalation paths  

### Helpful (Optional) Prep Resources
- Intro to APIs & Webhooks (high-level understanding)
- Basic database concepts (tables, schema, rows)
- General overview of automation tools

> These are **not prerequisites** — they are preparation aids.

## Program Structure Overview

| Phase | Weeks | Purpose |
|-----|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Weeks 1–6 | Build agent fundamentals & control |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 7–10 | Agent mastery through real group projects |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 11–13 | Deployment, productization & handover |

---

## Phase 1 – Agent Foundations (Weeks 1–6)

> Goal: Ensure every participant can independently design **safe, reliable agents** before moving to advanced projects.

| Week | Theme | What You Learn (Concepts) | What You Build | Capability Gained |
|-----|------|----------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Week 1 | Chat Trigger + Telegram + Knowledge Base (Basics) | Agent fundamentals, chat triggers, Knowledge Base, agent boundaries | Knowledge-answering agent | Agent flow thinking |
| Week 2 | Chat Trigger + Telegram + Knowledge Base (Implementation) | Context handling, embeddings intro, hallucination control | Context-aware chat agent | Reliable information agents |
| Week 3 | Email Trigger + Database (Basics) | Structured data capture, schema design, audit trails | Email-to-database agent | Data-aware agent thinking |
| Week 4 | Schedule Trigger + DB + Reporting | Reporting cadence, summaries, accountability | Scheduled reporting agent | Operational automation |
| Week 5 | Logic, Routing & Loops (Basics) | Decision trees, batching, loops | Bulk-processing agent | Control-flow mastery |
| Week 6 | Logic, Routing & Loops (Advanced) | Error handling, retries, failure isolation | Fault-tolerant workflow | Production readiness |

**Phase 1 Outcome:**  
You can build agents that are **controlled, explainable, and reliable**.

---

## Phase 2 – Agent Mastery Through Group Projects (Weeks 7–10)

> Goal: Move from *building agents* to *designing agent systems*.

This phase is **project-driven and collaborative**.

- A **few high-impact projects are pre-defined**
- Participants are **encouraged to give feedback**
- Project scope may evolve based on cohort needs

### Planned Group Projects (Initial Set)

| Week | Group Project | Key Concepts Covered | System Built | Why This Matters |
|-----|--------------|----------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Week 7 | Tool-Using Personal Assistant (MCP) | Tool permissions, memory, delegation | Multi-tool assistant | Safe AI delegation |
| Week 8 | Agentic RAG System | Retrieval strategy, chunking, limits | RAG agent (answer + act) | Replace doc-heavy work |
| Week 9 | Multi-Agent System | Planner/worker agents, escalation | Coordinated agent team | Handle complex workflows |
| Week 10 | Business Automation Agent | Human-in-loop, observability, cost | End-to-end business agent | Enterprise readiness |

**Phase 2 Outcome:**  
You develop **Agent Mastery** — the ability to reason about *why*, *how*, and *when* agents should operate.

---

## Phase 3 – Deployment & Productization (Weeks 11–13)

> Goal: Turn agents into **real, usable products**.

| Week | Theme | Focus Areas | Output |
|-----|------|-------------|--------|
| Week 11 | Lovable – Website Agent | UI, backend, auth, trust UX | Web-based agent app |
| Week 12 | Lovable – Chat Application | Embedded chat, memory, UX | Customer-facing agent |
| Week 13 | Lovable – Webhooks & Forms | Triggers, monitoring, handover | Fully deployed solution |

**Phase 3 Outcome:**  
You can deploy agents that are **usable, observable, and maintainable**.

---

## Domain Project Selection (Choose 1–2)

After completing the foundation and group projects, participants **choose 1–2 domain-specific agents** to implement with **one-to-one coaching support**.

> These projects indicate the **types of agents you will be capable of building** after the 13-week foundation.

### Example Project Options

| Domain | Agent Type | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Marketing | Social Media Intelligence Agent | Research trends & content ideas |
| Marketing | Content Repurposing Agent | Multi-format content generation |
| Sales | Lead Qualification Agent | Score & route leads |
| Sales | Sales Follow-up Agent | Automate follow-ups |
| Customer Success | Support Triage Agent | Answer, route, escalate |
| Operations | Internal Ops Assistant | Coordination & reporting |
| Leadership | Executive Briefing Agent | Decision-ready summaries |

Participants may **propose custom projects** aligned with their role or business.

## Certification Criteria

Certification is based on **what you build and deploy**, not attendance.

Evaluation includes:
- Business relevance
- Agent design & decision logic
- Error handling & escalation
- Deployment quality
- Ability to explain tradeoffs

**No completed project = No certification**
